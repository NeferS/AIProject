# AIProject

This project consists in programming an artificial intelligence which can play the Dipole board game. The proposed implementation makes use of multi-threading techniques, communication protocols with a server and the "Minimax algorithm" used in combination with the "Iterative Deepening" technique. After the deadline for project submitting, the professor organized an AIs tournament between the students of faculty of Computer Engineering at University of Calabria, Italy. This AI won the tournament, which lasted two days, and it was unbeated for the entire first day.
